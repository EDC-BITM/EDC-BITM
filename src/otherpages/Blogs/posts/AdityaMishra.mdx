## Nishant Singh | Founder, CRMNEXT

Every bank claims to be customer-first. In reality, most banks are system-first.

Customer data sits in one database, service history in another, loans in a third, and relationship managers operate with incomplete context. Customers never see this internal fragmentation, but they experience its consequences every day through slow service, repeated paperwork, and inconsistent communication.

This gap was identified early by Nishant Singh, a BIT Mesra alumnus, who went on to found CRMNEXT. Today, the platform operates as a flagship enterprise product under the BUSINESSNEXT ecosystem.

The core problem was not a lack of data. It was an excess of scattered data.

A single banking customer might hold a fixed deposit, a credit card, and a home loan, each managed across different branches, channels, and internal teams. This fragmentation created a cluttered operating environment where banks struggled with weak lead conversion, low frontline productivity, and inconsistent customer engagement. Information existed everywhere, but there was no unified customer brain to act on it.

Nishant’s most strategic decision was focus.

Instead of building a generic CRM for all industries, CRMNEXT was designed specifically for BFSI. Banking is not a conventional business vertical. It is a high-frequency, high-trust operating system where errors are costly and context is everything. CRMNEXT treated banking with the seriousness of critical infrastructure, not sales software.

As described by BUSINESSNEXT, CRMNEXT is an AI and ML-driven, cloud-agnostic platform built to support transformation at enterprise scale. It unifies customer data, relationship intelligence, workflows, and analytics into a single system designed for real-time decision-making.

The impact is visible at scale. One of the flagship examples highlighted by BUSINESSNEXT is HDFC Bank, which manages approximately 200,000 customers daily across nearly 7,000 branches. CRMNEXT functions as a central intelligence layer, helping streamline operations, improve frontline efficiency, and deliver consistent customer experiences across geographies.

CRMNEXT stands as proof that innovation is not always about inventing something entirely new. Sometimes, it is about solving an old problem correctly. By rethinking customer intelligence as a core banking system rather than a peripheral tool, CRMNEXT built software strong enough to operate at massive scale.

> **Lesson:** In BFSI, customer experience improves only when customer intelligence is treated as infrastructure, not an add-on.
