## Mr. Kumar | Founder, docOPD

For most people, visiting a doctor is not only about illness. It is about time, money, and hesitation. Care is often postponed because classes cannot be missed, work cannot be skipped, or symptoms do not feel serious enough yet. These delays are rarely intentional. They are shaped by everyday pressures and the belief that healthcare can always be dealt with later.

Mr. Kumar noticed this pattern repeatedly. He realized that healthcare was not failing at moments of emergency. It was failing quietly in everyday moments, long before people ever reached a crisis.

India has no shortage of hospitals, doctors, or medical expertise. Yet access to primary healthcare often feels complicated and intimidating. Long queues, crowded OPDs, confusing procedures, and the indirect cost of missing work or classes make even a simple consultation feel like a burden. Preventive care gets ignored, early symptoms are dismissed, and manageable conditions turn serious. This gap, Mr. Kumar understood, was not just systemic. It was deeply human.

That insight led to the founding of docOPD in 2015. Headquartered in Delhi NCR, the HealthTech startup was built at the intersection of telemedicine and preventive care with a clear goal: to make primary healthcare accessible, affordable, and approachable. From the start, docOPD was not about digitizing hospitals or building another healthcare app. It was about rethinking how people experience healthcare in daily life.

Instead of pulling people into hospitals, Mr. Kumar reimagined the OPD itself. His belief was simple. Healthcare should adapt to people’s routines, not disrupt them. docOPD’s digital-first OPD model was designed to remove friction at every step by reducing waiting times, simplifying consultations, and making it easier to seek medical advice early, without fear or hesitation.

Through its platform, docOPD enables people across India to consult qualified doctors without long waits or complex procedures. Students, working professionals, and families can access medical guidance from familiar environments. This accessibility shifts healthcare from being reactive to proactive, encouraging people to address concerns before they escalate.

Prevention lies at the heart of this approach. Mr. Kumar recognized that healthcare systems are overwhelmed not because people seek help too often, but because they seek it too late. By promoting early diagnosis and routine check-ups, docOPD helps reduce unnecessary hospital visits while ensuring timely medical guidance. Small concerns are addressed early, stress is reduced, and hospitals can focus resources on cases that truly require advanced care.

Over time, docOPD evolved into more than a service. It became a supporting layer within the healthcare ecosystem. Rather than competing with hospitals or doctors, the platform strengthens them by acting as a first point of contact and guiding patients through appropriate care pathways. This ecosystem-first thinking allowed docOPD to scale responsibly while staying aligned with its mission of trust and accessibility.

Today, docOPD is backed by a team of over 100 professionals across healthcare, technology, and operations. The company is valued at approximately $20–30 million, reflecting its growing relevance in India’s digital health landscape. For Mr. Kumar, however, these numbers are milestones, not the measure of success.

The real impact lies in everyday decisions. A student who no longer ignores recurring symptoms. A professional who seeks advice before a condition worsens. A family that begins treating preventive care as a routine, not an exception. These quiet changes, multiplied across thousands of users, gradually reshape how healthcare is perceived and accessed.

Mr. Kumar did not aim to build a louder or more complex system. He focused on building a kinder one rooted in trust, simplicity, and empathy. docOPD stands as proof that meaningful healthcare innovation does not always come from dramatic disruption. Sometimes, it comes from noticing hesitation and choosing to design with people at the center.

> **Lesson:** The future of healthcare is not just in hospitals, but in making care easy enough that people do not postpone it.
