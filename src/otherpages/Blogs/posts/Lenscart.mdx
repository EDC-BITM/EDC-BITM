## Amit Chaudhary | Co-Founder, Lenskart

We live in an age of instant gratification. Food, transport, and entertainment arrive with a tap. But in 2009, buying a pair of eyeglasses meant stepping back into a slow, inconvenient, and often overpriced past. This was the reality that Amit Chaudhary and his co-founders looked at and decided to challenge.

For Amit, a graduate of Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, entrepreneurship did not begin with a vague desire to build a startup. It began with identifying a systemic flaw. The Indian eyewear market was dominated by a handful of players offering limited designs, opaque pricing, and an experience that felt more like a chore than retail. Everyone needed glasses. No one enjoyed buying them.

That friction became the blueprint for Lenskart.

Founded in 2010, Lenskart made an early and risky bet on e-commerce at a time when online retail in India was still met with skepticism. The first challenge was trust. Eyeglasses are personal, fit-specific, and directly affect vision. Critics were vocal. How could customers buy frames without trying them on? What if the prescription was wrong? What if the glasses did not suit the face?

These were not edge cases. They were the very reasons eyewear had remained offline for decades.

Lenskart’s response was methodical. Instead of dismissing these concerns, the company engineered solutions around them. To address the fear of fit and appearance, Lenskart invested early in augmented reality, building one of India’s first robust virtual try-on platforms. Customers could see hundreds of frames on their own face in real time, from home. This was not a marketing gimmick. It was a trust-building tool that returned control to the customer.

The second problem was precision. A single incorrect prescription could destroy credibility. Lenskart tackled this by innovating on the home eye test, combining smartphone-based guidance with a simple testing kit. On the backend, the company built factory-grade systems for lens grinding and coating, turning manufacturing into a technology-driven operation focused on accuracy and consistency.

Pricing was the next barrier. Traditional eyewear pricing was opaque, bundled, and confusing. Lenskart simplified this by introducing transparent, upfront pricing, often at nearly half the market rate. Frames and lenses were no longer a mystery. Customers knew exactly what they were paying for.

The most consequential decision, however, came later.

While many digital-native brands chose to remain purely online, Lenskart took the opposite path. Amit understood a fundamental truth about Indian consumers. The desire for physical reassurance never fully disappears. To win complete trust and serve the full market, Lenskart needed to exist both online and offline.

This led to the creation of one of the most ambitious omnichannel retail networks in Indian consumer tech. Building physical stores from scratch was capital-intensive and operationally complex, but Lenskart did not treat stores as separate entities. Every outlet was powered by the same technology stack as the website. Customers could shortlist frames online and find them waiting in-store. Eye tests conducted in stores synced instantly to user profiles. Prescriptions became portable, persistent, and digital.

This seamless integration became Lenskart’s moat. It was not an online brand reluctantly opening stores. It was a unified vision ecosystem.

Today, that ecosystem spans more than 2,000 physical stores.

The scale of Lenskart’s growth reflects the strength of this approach. From serving its first thousand online customers, the company now caters to over 100 million users globally. It employs more than 10,000 people across engineering, manufacturing, and retail. With an estimated valuation between $8 and $10 billion and a public listing on the horizon, Lenskart operates across India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and the United States.

Yet the essence of Amit Chaudhary’s journey returns to a simple idea. It was about refusing to accept everyday frustration as inevitable. Eyewear was not hard to buy because it had to be. It was hard because no one had broken the problem down into solvable parts.

Lenskart did exactly that. Fit. Prescription. Price. Access. Each friction point was isolated and solved with technology, operational discipline, and patience.

Amit Chaudhary’s legacy is not just the company he built, but the standard he set. He showed that industries evolve not through disruption alone, but through relentless attention to user experience. By rethinking a routine errand, he transformed eyewear into a seamless, modern service.

In doing so, he did not just build a successful business. He redefined how an entire industry could work.

> **Lesson:** Transformative companies are built by obsessing over everyday problems until they disappear.
