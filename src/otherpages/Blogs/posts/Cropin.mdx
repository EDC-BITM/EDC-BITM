## Kunal Prasad | Founder, Cropin

In the global startup ecosystem, innovation is usually associated with glowing screens, electric vehicles, or the latest shifts in finance. While most of the tech world looked upward at dashboards and devices, Krishna Kumar looked down at the soil.

In 2010, he noticed something deeply broken in India’s vast agricultural landscape. Despite being the foundation of human survival, farming operated largely in the dark. Farmers made high-stakes decisions based on intuition. Global food supply chains ran on assumptions. A massive gap in reliable, real-time information quietly dictated outcomes. From this realization, Cropin was born, not merely as a company, but as an attempt to give the planet’s farmland a digital nervous system.

For decades, agriculture suffered from an information black hole. The problem was deeply systemic. Smallholder farmers, who form the backbone of global food production, were effectively gambling every season. Without access to weather intelligence, soil diagnostics, or pest forecasting, a single adverse event could erase an entire year’s income.

At the other end of the spectrum, global CPG companies and food retailers managed supply chains with minimal visibility. They knew what they were buying, but not how it was grown, whether it was sustainable, or how climate disruptions could impact future availability. This opacity also made farmers unbankable. Without verifiable yield data, financial institutions viewed them as high-risk, cutting off access to credit and modernization.

Cropin’s response was audacious. The company set out to build a digital twin of the world’s cultivable land.

Instead of building a simple farm-management app, Cropin created the world’s first integrated Ag-Intelligence cloud. By combining satellite imagery, on-ground IoT data, and advanced machine learning models, the platform treats every acre as a living data point. Agriculture was no longer anecdotal. It became measurable, predictable, and analyzable.

Today, Cropin’s Crop Knowledge Grid spans over 400 crops and 10,000 varieties across more than 103 countries. This intelligence layer decodes complex biological and environmental variables into clear, actionable insights, effectively turning farming into a data-driven discipline.

The inflection point came with the launch of Cropin Sage, a generative AI-powered intelligence layer. Instead of drowning users in dashboards, Sage translates complexity into answers. Governments, seed companies, and agribusinesses can ask forward-looking questions about climate resilience, crop viability, and supply stability and receive predictive insights in seconds.

This marked a shift from reactive damage control to proactive intelligence. Cropin moved agriculture from manual monitoring to a scalable B2B SaaS model, impacting more than 7 million farmers and covering over 30 million acres globally.

From a Bangalore-based startup in 2010 to a global agritech leader valued near $100 million, Cropin’s journey is a masterclass in purposeful innovation. Perhaps its most important lesson is that empathy must come before code. While much of the tech industry chased fleeting trends, Cropin focused on food security and climate resilience, problems that are foundational rather than fashionable.

They proved that data is the new fertilizer. In the 21st century, knowing when and where to plant is as critical as the seeds themselves. By delivering this intelligence, Cropin did not just help businesses scale. It helped stabilize global food systems. Their $45 million in funding and international expansion followed naturally.

Another critical lesson lies in scalability through flexibility. Agriculture is inherently local. What works for a rice farmer in Vietnam does not apply to a wheat farmer in Kansas. Cropin succeeded by building a global intelligence core that adapts to local languages, soil types, crops, and regulations. They did not build a tool. They built a global standard.

As the world moves toward a population of 10 billion, companies like Cropin are no longer optional. They are essential. By turning soil into data, Cropin is ensuring that the future of food is defined by intelligence rather than uncertainty.

> **Lesson:** In agriculture, data is not an advantage. It is survival.
