## Indus Khaitan | Founder, RedBlock

Some entrepreneurial journeys do not begin in boardrooms or venture studios. They begin in college corridors filled with ambition, curiosity, and code.

Indus Khaitan’s story starts at Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, where he studied Computer Science. Over time, his work across enterprise SaaS and cloud security exposed a persistent flaw in how organizations handle identity security. That frustration became the foundation for RedBlock, founded in 2023.

In large organizations, identity security rarely collapses loudly. Instead, it erodes quietly. Access remains active long after employees leave, privileges accumulate without review, and security teams rely on spreadsheets, approval emails, and manual tickets to manage sensitive systems. These inefficiencies slowly create operational blind spots that grow risk over time.

At its core, RedBlock is a cybersecurity and identity automation startup powered by Agentic AI. While traditional tools such as IAM, IGA, and PAM provide strong structural frameworks, they often fail at execution. Disconnected applications and manual workflows continue to dominate identity operations.

RedBlock was built to bridge this gap. Rather than replacing existing identity systems, it integrates with them and automates the execution layer within strict governance boundaries. The platform focuses on onboarding, offboarding, privilege cleanup, access reviews, and reconciliation without relying on fragile scripts or human intervention.

Instead of building another monitoring dashboard, Indus designed RedBlock around AI that can act, not just observe.

> “The biggest threat to enterprise security today is not the absence of tools. It is the amount of human effort required to make those tools work.”

With RedBlock in place, enterprises move away from spreadsheets and reactive processes. Provisioning, revocation, exception handling, and reconciliation become automated while maintaining auditability and control. As Indus explains, the goal was never to replace security teams, but to remove the operational noise that prevents them from doing real security work.

RedBlock stands as proof that modern identity security is not about more dashboards or alerts. It is about execution, automation, and trust at scale. What began as a problem noticed inside broken enterprise workflows has evolved into an AI-driven platform reshaping how organizations think about access and control.
