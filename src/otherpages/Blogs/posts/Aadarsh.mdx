## Ankit Jain | Founder, MyOperator

In business, silence is not golden. It is expensive.

Picture a small business owner in a Tier-2 Indian city, busy closing a deal. His phone rings once, twice, three times, and then stops. He assumes it was a distraction. On the other end, however, was a customer ready to place an order worth ₹50,000. That customer never called back. They called a competitor.

This invisible leak was quietly drowning thousands of Indian businesses. They were not failing because of bad products or poor service. They were failing because they were unreachable.

This was the problem that Ankit Jain, a BIT Mesra alumnus, noticed long before most others did.

Ankit did not start with cloud telephony. In 2011, he founded VoiceTree Technologies with the idea of building a rural infotainment platform. The product worked. Traffic came in. People listened. Revenue, however, did not. Operating out of a cramped one-bedroom apartment, he watched servers stay busy while his bank balance stayed empty.

The pivot came from a simple realization. The technology he had built for rural India could solve a far more urgent problem for urban India: chaos management for small and medium businesses.

At the time, cloud telephony already existed, but only for large enterprises. Setting up a call center meant expensive hardware, complex wiring, and dedicated IT staff. For a small travel agent, startup, or local business, this was simply out of reach.

Ankit’s breakthrough was not technical complexity. It was simplicity.

Launched in 2013, MyOperator promised instant activation. Businesses could go live in under 30 seconds with no hardware. The platform provided a virtual number that tracked, routed, and logged every call. Even if a call was missed, the lead was not.

What began as a scrappy pivot evolved into a full-scale cloud telephony engine. Today, MyOperator supports more than 12,000 businesses, including enterprises such as Lenskart and Snapdeal. The company operates with a team of over 150 professionals and carries an estimated valuation between $40 and $60 million, placing it firmly in soonicorn territory.

The platform’s reliability has been tested at national scale. MyOperator has powered large-scale election campaigns for the Government of India and supported high-traffic national broadcasts such as the Prime Minister’s Mann Ki Baat. These deployments proved that what worked for a small shop could also withstand the demands of an entire country.

The story of MyOperator reinforces a hard truth about entrepreneurship. Great companies are not always built by inventing something new. They are built by paying attention to problems everyone else ignores.

Ankit Jain did not chase AI hype or futuristic fantasies. He listened to a sound most people dismissed as noise: a missed call. In doing so, he uncovered a massive opportunity hiding in plain sight.

> **Lesson:** The most valuable ideas often look boring, until you realize how expensive it is to ignore them.
