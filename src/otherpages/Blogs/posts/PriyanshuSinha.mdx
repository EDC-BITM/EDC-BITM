## Rajeev Gupta | Founder, DBSync

There is a quiet irony in modern business. The more successful a company’s tech stack becomes, the more chaotic its data often is.

When organizations layer platforms like Salesforce, NetSuite, and QuickBooks, they rarely integrate them cleanly. Instead, they create data silos, isolated systems that refuse to communicate. Teams are pushed into manual data entry, reconciliation, and error correction. Sales representatives end up spending nearly 65 percent of their time on administrative work instead of revenue generation. This invisible friction is what Rajeev Gupta set out to eliminate.

Rajeev did not follow the loud Silicon Valley formula of aggressive fundraising and flashy launches. His approach was rooted in quiet execution. Drawing from his engineering background at Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, he bootstrapped DBSync with a focus on structural integrity rather than surface-level polish.

The bet was simple. Enterprise customers would value reliability more than hype. That bet paid off.

Today, DBSync serves more than 2,000 customers globally. It operates in a space most companies never notice: the plumbing of enterprise software. Yet this is exactly where long-term value is created. When systems work quietly and consistently, businesses scale without friction.

One of the most expensive problems DBSync tackled is what can be called the storage trap. Cloud providers often charge exorbitant fees for storing and querying replicated data. In some cases, companies pay over $1,500 for just 500MB of cloud storage, turning data growth into a recurring financial leak.

DBSync addressed this problem through two tightly engineered solutions.

The first is no-code automation. Using a drag-and-drop interface, DBSync automates critical workflows such as the Order-to-Cash cycle, instantly syncing CRM deals with accounting systems. This removes manual handoffs and reduces operational delays.

The second is SaaS replication. Instead of constantly re-syncing entire datasets, DBSync mirrors cloud data to local databases and updates only what has changed. This approach keeps systems fast while dramatically reducing storage and query costs.

The results speak louder than marketing ever could. DBSync achieved 107 percent growth over three years and earned a place on the Financial Times list of fastest-growing companies. By reducing project delivery timelines by 25 percent, the company reached an estimated valuation between $40 and $60 million.

The DBSync journey reinforces a critical lesson about enterprise software. Reliability is the real currency. The most valuable companies are not always the loudest or most visible. They are the ones businesses cannot afford to turn off.

> **Lesson:** In enterprise software, success is not about attention. It is about becoming indispensable.
