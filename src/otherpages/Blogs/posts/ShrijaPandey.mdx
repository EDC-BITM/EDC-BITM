## Abhinav Sinha | Founder, Eko

When Abhinav Sinha walked through the gates of Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra in 1999, he entered one of India’s most demanding engineering corridors. Like many of his peers in the Class of 2003, he spent his years mastering systems, circuits, and the logic of complex networks.

His early career at global technology companies placed him deep inside the world of corporate software. Yet the problem that ultimately defined his journey did not exist in data centers or server rooms. It existed on the streets of Delhi, in the everyday struggles of migrant workers who quietly keep India’s urban economy alive.

By 2007, Abhinav and his brother Abhishek began to question the popular “India Shining” narrative. Mobile phones were spreading rapidly, powered by a telecom network that worked around the clock. Banking, however, remained locked behind rigid hours, intimidating paperwork, and physical branches that felt inaccessible to millions.

For a construction laborer or rickshaw puller, sending money home to a village in Bihar was an exercise in humiliation. Traditional banks operated between fixed hours and demanded documentation that many did not possess. As a result, workers relied on informal cash networks that were slow, expensive, and unsafe. Abhinav saw this as a systemic failure. If telecom networks could operate 24x7 with near-zero friction, why couldn’t banking?

This question became the foundation of Eko Bharat Ventures.

The solution Abhinav envisioned was not a sleek smartphone app. In 2007, such an idea would have been irrelevant to the unbanked. Instead, he focused on building a humanized technology bridge. Drawing on systems thinking from his engineering background, he helped pioneer the Business Correspondent model.

Eko transformed local kirana store owners into neighborhood bankers. Abhinav understood a critical human insight. While many workers were intimidated by formal bank branches, they trusted their local grocer. By equipping these micro-entrepreneurs with a technology stack that worked on basic feature phones and required only number literacy, Eko made digital banking as simple and familiar as buying groceries.

As the company matured, Abhinav led Eko’s transition into an Open API platform. By opening its financial rails to more than 300 third-party partners, Eko enabled other entrepreneurs to build financial products on top of its secure infrastructure. This shift did not just scale the business. It created a decentralized ecosystem capable of reaching deep into Bharat.

The scale of impact is significant. Eko has served over 50 million customers, a population larger than many countries. Its network includes more than 150,000 retail partners offering over 100 financial services, from money transfers and bill payments to insurance. The platform processes more than 7 million banking transactions every month and is valued between $150 million and $200 million.

This work eventually attracted global recognition and support from the World Bank. Yet for Abhinav, success is not defined by valuation or investors. It is defined by dignity.

From the classrooms of BIT Mesra to the frontlines of financial inclusion, Abhinav Sinha’s journey shows that the most powerful innovations do not replace human connection. They amplify it. He did not just build a fintech company. He built a bridge of trust for India’s next 500 million.

> **Lesson:** Financial inclusion succeeds not by removing people from the system, but by designing systems around people.
