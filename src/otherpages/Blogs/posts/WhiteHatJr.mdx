## Karan Bajaj | Founder, WhiteHat Jr

Founded in 2018, WhiteHat Jr is an Indian EdTech startup that set out to address a critical gap in the global education system: the lack of early exposure to coding and computational thinking for children. The company was founded by Karan Bajaj, an entrepreneur, author, and BIT Mesra alumnus, whose vision was shaped by the belief that future generations must be equipped not just to use technology, but to build it.

Headquartered in India, WhiteHat Jr operates in the K–12 online learning space and was acquired by BYJU’S in 2020 at an estimated valuation of $300 million.

As digital technologies rapidly began shaping industries and careers, traditional school curricula struggled to keep pace. Coding, logical reasoning, and problem-solving skills essential for the 21st-century workforce were largely absent from early education. Most children interacted with technology only as consumers, with limited understanding of how digital products were created.

Parents recognized the importance of future-ready skills but lacked access to structured, credible, and personalized coding education for young learners. Existing learning models were often too theoretical, non-interactive, or inaccessible to a broad audience.

WhiteHat Jr addressed this gap by introducing a live, one-on-one online coding education model for children. The company developed a structured, age-appropriate curriculum centered on project-based learning, enabling students to build tangible outputs such as games, animations, and applications. This approach shifted learning away from rote memorization toward active creation, fostering logical thinking, creativity, and confidence.

In its early phase, WhiteHat Jr faced significant challenges. One major hurdle was earning parental trust, as online coding education for children was still a relatively new and unfamiliar concept. Demonstrating long-term value required clear communication and measurable learning outcomes.

Another challenge was rapid scaling while maintaining quality. Recruiting trained instructors, standardizing curriculum delivery, and ensuring consistent learning experiences across a growing student base demanded disciplined execution.

WhiteHat Jr’s journey illustrates how a startup can solve a real-world problem by aligning education with future needs. By identifying gaps in traditional learning systems and delivering a personalized, technology-driven solution, the company has played a meaningful role in reshaping early technology education for children globally.
