  Amit Chaudhary | Co-Founder, Lenskart
</h2>


In 2010, eyewear in India was fragmented, expensive, and deeply inefficient. Optical stores operated with limited inventory, opaque pricing, and minimal customer experience. Into this landscape stepped Amit Chaudhary, co-founding Lenskart with a vision that went far beyond selling glasses online.

What distinguished Lenskart early was not e-commerce, but vertical integration. The company invested heavily in supply chain control, in-house manufacturing, eye-testing technology, and data-driven retail expansion. Rather than choosing between online or offline, Lenskart pioneered a tech-enabled omnichannel model, using digital insights to optimize physical store placement and inventory.

Over time, Lenskart evolved into one of India’s most valuable consumer-tech companies, serving 100+ million customers globally, operating 2,000+ physical stores, and employing over 10,000 people. With an IPO-stage valuation estimated between $8–10 billion, the company operates across India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and the United States.

Lenskart’s journey highlights a critical insight: **Indian consumer tech does not win by copying Silicon Valley playbooks, it wins by understanding Indian unit economics at massive scale.**

> **Lesson:** Sustainable consumer brands are built by owning the value chain, not just the customer interface.
