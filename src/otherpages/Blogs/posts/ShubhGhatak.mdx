## Pulkit Sharma & Aankit Roy | Founders, Khabri

We often talk about how the internet has changed India. Smartphones are everywhere, from college students in Mumbai to farmers in remote villages of Bihar. On the surface, it feels like the digital revolution is complete. But a closer look reveals a deeper divide.

There are effectively two versions of the internet. One serves the English-speaking population in large cities, offering unlimited access to information. The other serves millions in small towns and villages who struggle to find quality content in their own language.

This was the problem identified by two alumni of Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Pulkit Sharma and Aankit Roy. While affordable data became widespread due to Jio, the information ecosystem remained blocked by language. High-quality knowledge was largely locked behind English, making learning intimidating for users in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.

The founders observed a crucial behavioral insight. Reading long, text-heavy content was a hurdle for many, but listening was effortless. India has a deep-rooted oral culture, from storytelling and radio to music and everyday conversations. This led to a simple but powerful question. Why was there no platform where people could listen to knowledge in Hindi or their local dialect?

That question led to the creation of Khabri.

The vision was straightforward but bold. Build a YouTube-like platform for audio and give a voice to the next billion internet users. The timing, however, was not in their favor. Around 2016 and 2017, the global startup ecosystem was obsessed with video. Investors and experts questioned why anyone would focus on audio when video engagement was exploding.

Pulkit and Aankit had a clear counterargument. They understood passive consumption.

Video demands attention and eyesight. Audio does not. You cannot watch videos while riding a bike, cooking food, or walking to class. But you can listen. Audio becomes a companion rather than a distraction. Khabri leaned into this insight, focusing on content that helped users progress in life, including government exam preparation, news, and motivational content, all delivered in Hindi.

Their conviction paid off. Khabri became the first Indian audio platform to be selected for Y Combinator, one of the most prestigious startup accelerators globally. This validation proved that a deeply local problem, when understood well, could have global relevance.

Another defining strength of Khabri was creator empowerment. Traditional content creation favored those comfortable on camera, with good equipment and editing skills. Khabri removed these barriers. If you had a phone and a voice, you could create. A teacher in a small town could record a short lesson and reach thousands of learners across the country. Content creation became accessible, inclusive, and democratic.

Today, Khabri serves millions of users. It is a critical resource for students preparing for competitive exams such as UPSC, SSC, and Railways, especially in regions lacking quality coaching infrastructure. It is also a powerful platform for the visually impaired, for whom the text-based internet was never truly accessible.

The journey of Pulkit Sharma and Aankit Roy highlights a fundamental truth about entrepreneurship. You do not always need futuristic ideas or complex technology. Often, the biggest opportunities lie in addressing basic human needs that others overlook. They saw people who wanted to learn but could not read English fluently. They saw unused time during commutes. Technology was simply the bridge.

In a world where everyone is trying to speak louder, Khabri chose to listen.

Their story is a reminder to every aspiring engineer and entrepreneur at BIT Mesra that background matters far less than vision. If you can identify a problem affecting millions and stay committed when others doubt your approach, you can build something that genuinely matters.

> **Lesson:** True digital inclusion is not just about cheap data. It is about building products that speak the user’s mother tongue.
